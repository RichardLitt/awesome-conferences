awesome-conferences is a community effort.

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- You should have been to the conference you're suggesting.
- You shouldn't be an organizer of the conference.
- The conference should be awesome. An awesome conference looks [like this](https://github.com/RichardLitt/awesome-conferences#what-makes-a-conference-awesome).
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Meetups are not normally conferences; please add stuff that is a bit more awesome than just a local 'talks-at-a-bar' recurring event.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Titles should be capitalized.
- Use the following format: ` - [Conference name](conference website) // [Twitter name](twitter link)`
- Link additions should be added alphabetized and in the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

If you are aware of awesome-conference lists, please add them!

If you aware of a significant (more than one) amount of conferences in other languages, please create a section for them. A German and a Chinese conference list would be particularly great.

Thank you for your suggestions!
